# Banking Interest Simulator

## 📌 Aim
The aim of this project is to simulate banking interest calculation, allowing the user to compute the final balance by adding yearly interest to the principal amount over a specified number of years.

---

## 📖 Project Description
The Banking Interest Simulator is a C program that calculates compound interest by updating the account balance every year. The program takes input from the user and applies the interest rate annually to show how the balance grows over time.

## ⚙️ Features
- Takes user input for principal, interest rate, and years
- Calculates yearly interest
- Updates balance annually
- Displays balance after each year
- Displays final balance at the end

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read principal amount, rate of interest, and number of years.
2. Store the principal amount as the initial balance.
3. Run a loop for the given number of years.
4. Calculate interest for each year.
5. Add interest to the balance.
6. Update the balance after each year.
7. After completing all years, display the final balance.
